#   Airline-ticketing-system
The Airline Ticketing System is a web-based application that allows users to search and book flights. 
The system utilizes Java EE technologies such as JSP for front-end rendering, JPA for data persistence,
and RESTful web services for API development.
#  The application consists of several components:
* User Interface: The front-end interface is built using JSP, allowing users to search for flights based
  on criteria like origin, destination, and date. The interface also displays available flights and allows users to select and book tickets.

* Data Persistence: JPA is used for interacting with the database. It provides an object-relational mapping mechanism, allowing the application
* to store and retrieve flight information, user details, and booking records.

* RESTful API: The system exposes RESTful web services to handle operations such as flight search, ticket booking, and user authentication.
  These APIs follow REST principles and use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication between the client and server.

* Business Logic: The application implements business logic to handle flight availability, pricing, seat selection,
* and booking confirmation. It also includes validation checks to ensure data integrity and security.
