#   Airline-ticketing-system
The Airline Ticketing System is a web-based application that allows users to search and book flights. 
The system utilizes Java EE technologies such as JSP for front-end rendering, JPA for data persistence,
and RESTful web services for API development.
#  The application consists of several components:
* User Interface: The front-end interface is built using JSP, allowing users to search for flights based
  on criteria like origin, destination, and date. The interface also displays available flights and allows users to select and book tickets.

* Data Persistence: JPA is used for interacting with the database. It provides an object-relational mapping mechanism, allowing the application
* to store and retrieve flight information, user details, and booking records.

* RESTful API: The system exposes RESTful web services to handle operations such as flight search, ticket booking, and user authentication.
  These APIs follow REST principles and use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication between the client and server.

* Business Logic: The application implements business logic to handle flight availability, pricing, seat selection,
* and booking confirmation. It also includes validation checks to ensure data integrity and security.
#    Installation 
*  [Clone] (https://github.com/mcjibreen07/Airline-ticketing-system)
*  Install Server (Tomcat , Wildfly , or anyother )
*  Import the Project in any other the IDE (Jetbrain or Any)
*  Run Using Terminal or IDE Run Option
#    Contributions
*  Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
*  Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
*  Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
*  If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
*  Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
*  Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
*  Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
*  Write or adapt tests as needed.
*  Add or change the documentation as needed.
*  Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
*  Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
*  From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
...
Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
